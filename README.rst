Overview

The Nbsp GIS library is a collection of C programs and software library
for converting the NOAAPort radar (NIDS) and satellite (GINI) files
to GIS-compatible formats, such as shapefile and others.
It is a descendant of the Noaaport Broadcast System Processor (Nbsp) project.

The wiki has some examples about usage. See also the
